# Ionic Recipe Demos

This repo contains several demos for reusable recipe code for adding awesome UI experiences to your app.

Currently, the [Bottom Drawer](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-recipe-demos/tree/master/src/components/bottom-drawer) demo is the most mature.

## Running the Demos

We recommend running the demos natively in the provided Capacitor project. This will provide the highest quality experience.

```
npm install
npx cap sync
npx cap open ios
```

Then, run the app in Xcode or Android Studio.

Alternatively, you can preview the demos in the browser by running `npm start`
